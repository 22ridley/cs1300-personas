        <p class="name">Sarah Ridley ● Brown University ● February 2025</p>
        <p class="txt">
          This case study examines a public interface through the lens of users
          with different experiences, needs, and results. The goal is to learn
          the perspectives of these users through interviews and observations,
          and ultimately create personas to understand how this interface does
          or does not meet the needs of these users.

        <br />
        <p class="txt">
          The interface I chose for this Case Study is the laundry machine
          screen in the dorm buildings at Brown University. This screen
          integrates closely with the washers and dryers themselves, but I will
          focus on the screen. The problem this interface is trying to solve is
          enabling students to do laundry. The touch screen, which is physically
          separate from the washers and dryers, is where users select machines
          and 'pay' (laundry is free for Brown students, although they must
          swipe their ID cards). The users press `Start` on the machines
          themselves after paying on the touch screen.

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p class="txt">
          After creating my sketch of ths interace, I then brainstormed the
          questions I needed to ask users to understand how they use the
          interface and whether it meets their needs. Below is the list of
          questions, and if you click on one, you can read about what I hope to
          gain by asking each question.

        <div class="questions">
          <details>
            <summary>1. What is your class year at Brown?</summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This question indirectly gains an understanding of how long the
              interviewee has been using these laundry machines. Asking a
              student "About how many times have you used the laundry machines
              at Brown?" could lead to overestimation, in order to avoid
              appearing like they don't wash their clothes enough.

              2. Whenever it's time to interact with the laundry interface at
              Brown, what's the main thing on your mind?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This question aims to understand the interviewee's main priority
              while they're washing their clothes, without asking directly what
              they care most about. This question should prompt users to talk
              about whether they're focused on getting their laundry done
              quickly, or thoroughly, or just to getting it done at all.

              3. How would you describe the laundry machine interface to someone
              who has never seen it before?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This question aims to get users thinking broadly about the laundry
              machine interfaces and give a general summary that might reveal
              their perspectives on the features or flaws of the system. This
              question also sets up the next couple of questions by prompting
              the interviewee to step into the mindset of a new user.

              4. Describe your first time using the laundry machines at Brown.
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              If the interviewee remembers their first experience with the
              laundry interface, they will hopefully recall the challenges faced
              when learning the system. This can reinforce areas of improvement
              for the interface in terms of learnability.

              5. In that first experience using the laundry interface, did it
              work as you expected it to?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This is a follow-up question to D that aims to further explore
              whether or not the laundry interface meets new users'
              expectations. This further digs into the question of whether this
              interface is designed to be learnable, and what frustrations might
              be common in the process of using this interface.

              6. Has your comfort using the laundry machines changed since your
              first semester?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              Turning to focus on the interviewee's current use of the
              interface, this question aims to illustrate a user that is more
              experienced with the system and has learned its quirks. This also
              prompts the interviewee to consider how their experience has
              changed over time, and how the memorable and efficient the
              interface is.
            </p>

          <details>

              7. Have you recently had any difficulties using these laundry
              machines?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              Although this question is more direct than former questions, these
              previous questions have put the interviewee in a mindset of
              comparing their past and present experiences with the laundry
              interface. This question therefore aims to specifically understand
              how the laundry interface may still not be meeting the needs of
              experienced users.

              8. What would you change about how this laundry interface works?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              Finally, this is an open-ended question that asks broadly about
              what the interviewee might change about the system. This change
              could reveal a feature that could make the interface more
              learnable, memorable, or efficient, or further highlight what
              flaws currently prevent the interface from meeting users' needs.

              <br />
              &emsp;The 3 Brown students that I observed all interacted with the
              laundry machine interface in a similar order of tasks. They each
              poked their head into the laundry room to see if there were
              available machines, then loaded their laundry into either washers
              or dryers, added their detergent/drier sheets, and then approached
              the screen interface on the wall. One difference was that the
              first user I observed loaded clothing into two washers, whereas
              the second used one washer and the third used one dryer.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Each user stood directly in front of the screen interface. I
              noticed the first user taking their time with the interaction.
              They pressed the 'tap to get started' button, then selected the
              first washer they had loaded their clothes into. When that washer
              was selected, the screen changed to display the washer's default
              settings (light soil, normal cycle, cold water). The user seemed
              to want different settings, so they left the screen and pressed
              buttons on the first washer to update the settings. They returned
              to the screen, added their second washer, approached their second
              washer to update the settings, then returned to the screen. They
              finished the interaction slowly but without a sense of confusion.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;The second and third users completed their interactions with
              more of a sense of urgency. Neither user changed the default
              settings, and they quickly tapped through the options on the
              screen, seemingly without much consideration.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;However, the third user waas slowed down by swiping their
              Brown card with the wrong orientation the first time they tried.
              They quickly swiped their card again facing the other direction,
              quickly finished the pseudo-payment process, and pressed 'Start'
              on their dryer.

              <b>1. What is your class year at Brown?</b> <br /><br />&emsp;The
              first and third students I interviewed were juniors, and the
              second student was a sophomore. So, these students have all used
              this laundry system for at least 3 semesters, and could all be
              considered experienced users. <br /><br />
              <b
                >2. Whenever it's time to interact with the laundry interface at
                Brown, what's the main thing on your mind?</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;The first user didn't seem to fully understand that
              question, so I clarified by asking what their main priority was
              when using the laundry system. They answered that their main focus
              was just checking one of the chores off their list of weekend
              to-dos (I conducted these interviews on a Sunday). Similarly, the
              third also emphasized getting it done and getting their clothes
              clean for the week. Somewhat differently, the second user said
              their main focus was getting the laundry done as quickly as
              possible, since sometimes when they try to do their laundry, there
              isn't a machine available.<br /><br />
              <b
                >3. How would you describe the laundry interface to someone who
                has never seen it before?</b
              >
              <br /><br />&emsp;The general pattern that all three users
              outlined was the process of loading their machines, using the
              touch screen to select the machines, swiping the Brown ID, and
              pressing `Start` on the machine. The third user mentioned
              sheepishly that you have to swipe your card with the metal strip
              facing left, awknowledging that they mix this up a lot (since a
              lot of the other card readers on campus are oriented the opposite
              direction). The second user mentioned that its useful to set an
              alarm on your phone to know when to pick up your laundry, but this
              is more related to the laundry system in general than the laundry
              screen interface. <br /><br />
              <b
                >4. Describe your first time using the laundry machines at
                Brown.</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;Each of the students had to think for a bit, and none of
              them seemed to have very strong memories of their first
              experience. Instead, the first user described that they don't
              remember having any difficulty doing their laundry at Brown since
              they've always done it at home. The second user mentioned that
              they found the interface a little strange the first few times they
              used it, since you need to swipe your Brown ID, even though the
              laundry is free. The third user emphasized that they don't think
              it took a while to learn how to use the interface since the
              instructions on the touch screen are fairly clear.
              <br /><br />
              <b
                >5. In that first experience using the laundry interface, did it
                work as you expected it to?</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;Similar to the previous question, the interviewees didn't
              exactly recall what they had expected the first time they used the
              machines. The second user emphasized that their main expectation
              was to get their clothes clean, and the screen interface enabled
              that for them. Also, the first user noted that the touch screen
              interface resembles and iPad, and it generally works the same as
              an iPad, so their expectations were met.<br /><br />
              <b
                >6. Has your comfort using the laundry machines changed since
