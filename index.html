        <h2>Case Study</h2>
        <h1>PERSONAS</h1>
        <p class="name">Sarah Ridley ● Brown University ● February 2025</p>
        <p class="txt">
          This case study examines a public interface through the lens of users
          with different experiences, needs, and results. The goal is to learn
          the perspectives of these users through interviews and observations,
          and ultimately create personas to understand how this interface does
          or does not meet the needs of these users.

          <b>Sketch of Laundry Interface at Brown University Goddard Dorm</b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="txt">
          The interface I chose for this Case Study is the laundry machine
          screen in the dorm buildings at Brown University. This screen
          integrates closely with the washers and dryers themselves, but I will
          focus on the screen. The problem this interface is trying to solve is
          enabling students to do laundry. The touch screen, which is physically
          separate from the washers and dryers, is where users select machines
          and 'pay' (laundry is free for Brown students, although they must
          swipe their ID cards). The users press `Start` on the machines
          themselves after paying on the touch screen.

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p class="txt">
          After creating my sketch of ths interace, I then brainstormed the
          questions I needed to ask users to understand how they use the
          interface and whether it meets their needs. Below is the list of
          questions, and if you click on one, you can read about what I hope to
          gain by asking each question.
        </p>
        <div class="questions">
          <details>
            <summary>1. What is your class year at Brown?</summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This question indirectly gains an understanding of how long the
              interviewee has been using these laundry machines. Asking a
              student "About how many times have you used the laundry machines
              at Brown?" could lead to overestimation, in order to avoid
              appearing like they don't wash their clothes enough.

              2. Whenever it's time to interact with the laundry interface at
              Brown, what's the main thing on your mind?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This question aims to understand the interviewee's main priority
              while they're washing their clothes, without asking directly what
              they care most about. This question should prompt users to talk
              about whether they're focused on getting their laundry done
              quickly, or thoroughly, or just to getting it done at all.

              3. How would you describe the laundry machine interface to someone
              who has never seen it before?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This question aims to get users thinking broadly about the laundry
              machine interfaces and give a general summary that might reveal
              their perspectives on the features or flaws of the system. This
              question also sets up the next couple of questions by prompting
              the interviewee to step into the mindset of a new user.

            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              If the interviewee remembers their first experience with the
              laundry interface, they will hopefully recall the challenges faced
              when learning the system. This can reinforce areas of improvement
              for the interface in terms of learnability.

              5. In that first experience using the laundry interface, did it
              work as you expected it to?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This is a follow-up question to D that aims to further explore
              whether or not the laundry interface meets new users'
              expectations. This further digs into the question of whether this
              interface is designed to be learnable, and what frustrations might
              be common in the process of using this interface.

              6. Has your comfort using the laundry screen changed since your
              first semester?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              Turning to focus on the interviewee's current use of the
              interface, this question aims to illustrate a user that is more
              experienced with the system and has learned its quirks. This also
              prompts the interviewee to consider how their experience has
              changed over time, and how the memorable and efficient the
              interface is.
            </p>

          <details>

              7. Have you recently had any difficulties using the laundry
              screen?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              Although this question is more direct than former questions, these
              previous questions have put the interviewee in a mindset of
              comparing their past and present experiences with the laundry
              interface. This question therefore aims to specifically understand
              how the laundry interface may still not be meeting the needs of
              experienced users.

              8. What would you change about how this laundry interface works?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              Finally, this is an open-ended question that asks broadly about
              what the interviewee might change about the system. This change
              could reveal a feature that could make the interface more
              learnable, memorable, or efficient, or further highlight what
              flaws currently prevent the interface from meeting users' needs.

              <br />
              &emsp;The 3 Brown students that I observed all interacted with the
              laundry machine interface in a similar order of tasks. They each
              poked their head into the laundry room to see if there were
              available machines, then loaded their laundry into either washers
              or dryers, added their detergent/drier sheets, and then approached
              the screen interface on the wall. One difference was that the
              first user I observed loaded clothing into two washers, whereas
              the second used one washer and the third used one dryer.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Each user stood directly in front of the screen interface. I
              noticed the first user taking their time with the interaction.
              They pressed the 'tap to get started' button, then selected the
              first washer they had loaded their clothes into. When that washer
              was selected, the screen changed to display the washer's default
              settings (light soil, normal cycle, cold water). The user seemed
              to want different settings, so they left the screen and pressed
              buttons on the first washer to update the settings. They returned
              to the screen, added their second washer, approached their second
              washer to update the settings, then returned to the screen. They
              finished the interaction slowly but without a sense of confusion.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;The second and third users completed their interactions with
              more of a sense of urgency. Neither user changed the default
              settings, and they quickly tapped through the options on the
              screen, seemingly without much consideration.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;However, the third user waas slowed down by swiping their
              Brown card with the wrong orientation the first time they tried.
              They quickly swiped their card again facing the other direction,
              quickly finished the pseudo-payment process, and pressed 'Start'
              on their dryer.

              <b>1. What is your class year at Brown?</b> <br /><br />&emsp;The
              first and third students I interviewed were juniors, and the
              second student was a sophomore. So, these students have all used
              this laundry system for at least 3 semesters, and could all be
              considered experienced users. <br /><br />
              <b
                >2. Whenever it's time to interact with the laundry interface at
                Brown, what's the main thing on your mind?</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;The first user didn't seem to fully understand that
              question, so I clarified by asking what their main priority was
              when using the laundry system. They answered that their main focus
              was just checking one of the chores off their list of weekend
              to-dos (I conducted these interviews on a Sunday). Similarly, the
              third also emphasized getting it done and getting their clothes
              clean for the week. Somewhat differently, the second user said
              their main focus was getting the laundry done as quickly as
              possible, since sometimes when they try to do their laundry, there
              isn't a machine available.<br /><br />
              <b
                >3. How would you describe the laundry interface to someone who
                has never seen it before?</b
              >
              <br /><br />&emsp;The general pattern that all three users
              outlined was the process of loading their machines, using the
              touch screen to select the machines, swiping the Brown ID, and
              pressing `Start` on the machine. The third user mentioned
              sheepishly that you have to swipe your card with the metal strip
              facing left, awknowledging that they mix this up a lot (since a
              lot of the other card readers on campus are oriented the opposite
              direction). The second user mentioned that its useful to set an
              alarm on your phone to know when to pick up your laundry, but this
              is more related to the laundry system in general than the laundry
              screen interface. <br /><br />
              <b
                >4. Describe your first time using the laundry screen at
                Brown.</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;Each of the students had to think for a bit to recall their
              first time using the screen to do their laundry. The first user
              described that they didn't remember having any difficulty doing
              their laundry at Brown since they've always done it at home. The
              second user mentioned that they found the interface a little
              strange the first few times they used it, since you need to swipe
              your Brown ID, even though the laundry is free. The third user
              noted that they had to ask another student for help the first time
              they used the screen since they were confused about to select
              machines.
              <br /><br />
              <b
                >5. In that first experience using the laundry screen, did it
                work as you expected it to?</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;Similar to the previous question, the interviewees didn't
              exactly recall what they had expected the first time they used the
              machines. The second user emphasized that their main expectation
              was to get their clothes clean, and the screen interface enabled
              that for them. Also, the first user noted that the touch screen
              interface resembles and iPad, and it generally works the same as
              an iPad, so their expectations were met.<br /><br />
              <b
                >6. Has your comfort using the laundry screen changed since your
                first semester?</b
              ><br /><br />&emsp;The general pattern in answers was that all 3
              users had gained comfort using the laundry interface and machines
              since their first time using it. The second user mentioned that
              they no longer had to think about what they were doing when using
              the screen interface, and just clicked the same buttons as always.
              The third user also added that the time it took to do their
              laundry was definitely less than the first time they did it.<br /><br />
              <b
                >7. Have you recently had any difficulties using the laundry
                screen?</b
              ><br /><br />&emsp;The first user mentioned that sometimes the
              buttons on the laundry screen were slow to respond to taps, but
              generally they had recently found the process smooth. The third
              user again noted that the direction of the card reader was
              annoying and tricky, but besides that, they hadn't had recent
              issues. The second user did not recall any recent issues.
              <br /><br />
              <b
                >8. What would you change about how this laundry interface
                works?</b
              ><br /><br />&emsp;The third user suggested having a clearer label
              indicating which way to swipe your Brown ID on the card reader
              that's part of the interactive screen. The first user couldn't
              think of any suggestions, and the second user took a minute to
              think. Eventually, the second user proposed more clear advice on
              how to use your phone to complete these interactions (the current
              mobile laundry app is confusing and not very useful). While I
              think this is a good idea, I asked if they had any suggestions for
              the physical interface, and they didn't have any ideas.

              The user's main problem is that they need to figure out how to use
              the screen interface in their process of doing the laundry.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user sees the washers first, and starts loading their clothes
              into the machine. They add their detergent and try to press the
              `Start` button, but nothing happens. With another student's help,
              the <b>Nervous First-year</b> realizes that they need to use the
              screen interface. With some difficulty, including swiping their
              card the wrong way and being unsure about what settings to use,
              they eventually get their laundry started.

              This <b>Nervous First-year</b> represents users of the laundry
              interface, because it is common for students to find the interface
              confusing the first time they use it. These students also have
              many other things on their minds while doing their laundry, which
              this empathy map also reflects.

            <p>
              This empathy map displays the <b>Rushed Upperclassman</b>, who is
              doing their laundry in between studying for an exam.
            </p>
            <p>
              This user is an upperclassman, and is comfortable with how the
              laundry machine interface works, so their main problem is getting
              their laundry done quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>Rushed Upperclassman</b> has tried to do their laundry
              before today, but the washers were all taken, and they're stressed
              because they need to get it done before their next class. But,
              they also need to study at some point too.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user takes someone else's finished laundry out of a washer,
              loads their clothes, and uses the screen to select that washer.
              They keep the default settings and accidentally swipe their card
              the wrong way, even though they've done this countless times
              before. They swipe the right way and run back upstairs to get some
              studying done before class.
            </p>
            <p>
              This persona represents the users of this interface because all
              students at Brown constantly are in a rush with many things to do.
              Also, one of the upperclassman noted that they swipe their card
              wrong sometimes, no matter how many times they have done their
              laundry. This represents how even experienced users can struggle
              with this interface.

        <p class="txt">
          After creating my personas for the <b>Nervous First-year</b> and the
          <b>Rushed Upperclassman</b>, I chose to create a storyboard for the
          <b>Nervous First-year</b>. The storyboard displays this user's entire
          user journey from start to end. As depicted below, the
          <b>Nervous First-year</b> is doing their laundry at college for the
          first time, and will face several challenges interacting with the
          laundry interface (with a main focus on the screen).

        <p class="txt">
          The troubles that this <b>Nervous First-year</b> faced (including not
          knowing how to change the settings, swiping their card the wrong way,
          and not understanding why they need to swipe their card for a free
          service) are not necessarily isolated to new users. As revealed in my
          interviews, these are issues with all three components of the
          usability — learnability, memorability, and efficiency — of this
          screen interface.
        </p>
        <p class="txt">
          This case study has shown that experienced users do get more
          comfortable with this interface over time, since there is not an
          alternative to this laundry system for most students. However, my
          findings do suggest several improvements that Brown University could
          make to their laundry system to better meet their users' needs. For
          example, the university could stop requiring students to swipe their
          Brown ID, given that laundry is free and only Brown students can
          access the laundry rooms. If swiping the card remains required, the
          university should at least add a clearer affordance for which
          direction to swipe it. This would save new and returning users time
          and increase the usability of this interface.
        </p>
        <p class="txt">
          Regardless of these points for improvement, this case study was a
          useful exercise in understanding and illustrating users' needs and
          experiences based on my observations. Thank you to those students who
          participated in interviews.
