        <h2>Case Study</h2>
        <h1>PERSONAS</h1>
        <p class="txt">
          This case study examines a public interface through the lens of users
          with different experiences, needs, and results. The goal is to learn
          the perspectives of these users through interviews and observations,
          and ultimately create personas to understand how this interface does
          or does not meet the needs of these users.

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p class="txt">
          The interface I chose for this Case Study is the laundry machines in
          the dorm buildings at Brown University. The skech above displays one
          such machine, as well as annotations describing how users interact
          with this interface. As shown, this interface is comprised of a touch
          screen as well as washers and dryers themselves. The touch screen,
          which is physically separate from the washers and dryers, is where
          users select machines and 'pay' (laundry is free for Brown students,
          although they must swipe their ID cards). The users press `Start` on
          the machines themselves after paying on the touch screen.

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p class="txt">
          After creating my sketch of ths interace, I then brainstormed the
          questions I needed to ask users to understand how they use the
          interface and whether it meets their needs. Below is the list of
          questions, and if you click on one, you can read about what I hope to
          gain by asking each question.
        </p>
        <div class="questions">
          <details>
            <summary>A. What is your class year at Brown?</summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This question indirectly gains an understanding of how long the
              interviewee has been using these laundry machines. Asking a
              student "About how many times have you used the laundry machines
              at Brown?" could lead to overestimation, in order to avoid
              appearing like they don't wash their clothes enough.

              B. Whenever it's time to interact with the laundry interface at
              Brown, what's the main thing on your mind?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This question aims to understand the interviewee's main priority
              while they're washing their clothes, without asking directly what
              they care most about. This question should prompt users to talk
              about whether they're focused on getting their laundry done
              quickly, or thoroughly, or just to do it at all (sometimes the
              laundry machines are all occupied so users aren't guaranteed to
              even be able to do their laundry when they want to).
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>
              C. How would you describe the laundry machine interface to someone
              who has never seen Brown's laundry system before?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This question aims to get users thinking broadly about the laundry
              machine interfaces and give a general summary that might reveal
              their perspectives on the features or flaws of the system. This
              question also sets up the next couple of questions by prompting
              the interviewee to step into the mindset of a new user.

              D. Describe your first time using the laundry machines at Brown.
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              If the interviewee remembers their first experience with the
              laundry interface, they will hopefully recall the challenges faced
              when learning the system. This can reinforce areas of improvement
              for the interface in terms of learnability.

              E. In that first experience using the laundry machines, did they
              work as you expected them to work?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              This is a follow-up question to D that aims to further explore
              whether or not the laundry interface meets new users'
              expectations. This further digs into the question of whether this
              interface is designed to be learnable, and what frustrations might
              be common in the process of using this interface.

              F. Has your comfort using the laundry machines changed since your
              first semester?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              Turning to focus on the interviewee's current use of the
              interface, this question aims to illustrate a user that is more
              experienced with the system and has learned its quirks. This also
              prompts the interviewee to consider how their experience has
              changed over time, and how the memorable and efficient the
              interface is.

              G. Have you recently had any difficulties using these laundry
              machines?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              Although this question is more direct than former questions, these
              previous questions have put the interviewee in a mindset of
              comparing their past and present experiences with the laundry
              interface. This question therefore aims to specifically understand
              how the laundry interface may still not be meeting the needs of
              experienced users.

              H. What would you change about how the laundry machine interface?
            </summary>
            <p class="expl">
              Finally, this is an open-ended question that asks broadly about
              what the interviewee might change about the system. This change
              could reveal a feature that could make the interface more
              learnable, memorable, or efficient, or further highlight what
              flaws currently prevent the interface from meeting users' needs.

          After preparing my questions, I observed and interviewed 3 Brown
          students using this laundry interface in the Goddard dormitory.

              <br />
              The 3 Brown students that I observed all interacted with the
              laundry machine interface in a similar order of tasks. They each
              poked their head into the laundry room to see if there were
              available machines, then loaded their laundry into either washers
              or dryers, added their detergent/drier sheets, and then approached
              the screen interface on the wall. One difference was that the
              first user I observed loaded clothing into two washers, whereas
              the second used one washer and the third used one dryer.
              <br /><br />
              Each user stood directly in front of the screen interface. I
              noticed the first user taking their time with the interaction.
              They pressed the 'tap to get started' button, then selected the
              first washer they had loaded their clothes into. When that washer
              was selected, the screen changed to display the washer's default
              settings (light soil, normal cycle, cold water). The user seemed
              to want different settings, so they left the screen and pressed
              buttons on the first washer to update the settings. They returned
              to the screen, added their second washer, approached their second
              washer to update the settings, then returned to the screen. They
              finished the interaction slowly but without a sense of confusion.
              <br /><br />
              The second and third users completed their interactions with more
              of a sense of urgency. Neither user changed the default settings,
              and they quickly tapped through the options on the screen,
              seemingly without much consideration.
              <br /><br />
              However, the third user waas slowed down by swiping their Brown
              card with the wrong orientation the first time they tried. They
              quickly swiped their card again facing the other direction,
              quickly finished the pseudo-payment process, and pressed 'Start'
              on their dryer.
